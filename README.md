## Diceware Passphrase Generator

Provides a command-line interface to generate strong passphrases using the
[Diceware word list](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc).

Diceware passphrase generator
-----------------------------
Usage: genpass [option]

--download-wordlist         Downloads wordlist to file "dicewarelist" using
                            wget. Can also be downloaded manually from
                            http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc
                            If downloaded manually, just rename it to
                            "dicewarelist" and run then run
                            --generate-passphrase as described below.

--generate-passphrase [n]   Generates passphrase of n words (defaults to 5 if
                            no parameter given).

Recommended usage is to run the --download-wordlist command, then wait for some
time before running the --generate-passphrase command (to make sure that
somebody monitoring your internet traffic cannot both know the exact time you
downloaded the list and generated the passphrase). Ideally, after downloading
the word list, disconnect from the internet while generating the passphrase.
```

Ideally, the passphrase should be generated by rolling physical dice, so using
this utility is only advisable if such a procedure is unavailable/infeasible.
Also, its author is not a cryptographer, so user-discretion is adviced.

This project is not related to Diceware. The [Diceware
website](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) contains a great
description of the logic behind the procedure.
